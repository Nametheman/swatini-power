            The ESCO model is an innovative solution that stands for "Energy
            Service Company." It enables organizations such as Swatini to
            perform energy-saving services without requiring clients to invest
            their own resources. Our process begins with an energy audit of the
            facilities, followed by the proposal of a cost-saving solution. We
            take care of the implementation, operation, and maintenance of the
            solution and provide financing, so the client can concentrate on
            their core business. Our guarantee of results is backed by the
            savings the client will experience, which will be used to repay us.
